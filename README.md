# Modeling-with-python-and-matlab-deep-learning-
Modeling snow properties on earth at the hemispheric scale using deep learning with python and matlab

This project required the preparation of several codes for data extraction and preparation with python, but it also contains codes for statistical modeling (deep learning) with both matlab and python.

# End of studies internship project

This end of study project in meteorology engineering had as objective the development of an empirical machine learning algorithm (deep learning) to retrieve the macro-physical properties (snow water equivalent and snow depth) of snow over land at the hemispheric scale (northern hemisphere) from the brightness temperature of the microwave spectrum derived from AMSR2 in order to prepare the next Copernicus mission. This internship is carried out at the Paris Observatory at the href="https://www.observatoiredeparis.psl.eu/lerma.html?lang=fr"> LERMA </a>  (Laboratoire d'étude du rayonnement et de la matière en astrophysique et atmosphère) for a duration of six months. It was financed by the Paris Observatory and supervised by Prof. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Catherine-Prigent"> Catherine Prigent</a>
